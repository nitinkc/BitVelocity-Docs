# Phase 5 ‚Äî Observability Baseline

## üè∑Ô∏è Domain Focus
**Primary**: üîß **Infrastructure** - Observability and monitoring  
**Cross-Domain**: üè™ **eCommerce**, üîí **Security** - Service instrumentation  
**Protocol Focus**: üì° **gRPC** bidirectional streaming

## Epic Integration: Observability Foundation (16 Story Points)
**Epic Objective**: Implement comprehensive observability with metrics collection, structured logging, and monitoring  
**Success Criteria**: Prometheus metrics collection, structured JSON logging with correlation IDs, health check endpoints, Grafana dashboards, basic alerting rules, log aggregation and searching

## Objectives
- Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation and monitoring infrastructure
- Build comprehensive observability for distributed microservices
- Learn gRPC patterns through service-to-service communication

## Deliverables
- OpenTelemetry configuration and instrumentation
- Grafana dashboards and Prometheus metrics
- gRPC service contracts and streaming examples

## Tasks (acceptance)
1) **Instrumentation with gRPC Learning (Story Points: 7)**
   - [ ] Trace IDs flow across calls; custom metrics exposed
   - [ ] **gRPC Protocol Lab**: Implement bidirectional streaming between services
     - Design `.proto` files with service definitions
     - Implement client/server streaming for real-time data feeds
     - Add gRPC interceptors for tracing and metrics
     - Compare performance vs REST endpoints
   - [ ] **Service Mesh Integration**: Configure gRPC load balancing and service discovery
   - [ ] **Implementation Tasks**:
     - Implement Prometheus metrics with Micrometer (4 pts)
     - Configure structured logging with Logback (3 pts)
   - [ ] **Modules**: auth, product (as exemplars)

2) **Dashboards & alerts with Protocol Observability (Story Points: 9)**
   - [ ] Grafana dashboards (latency, error rate, throughput)
   - [ ] **Protocol-specific metrics**: Track gRPC vs REST vs async message performance
   - [ ] **Distributed tracing**: Visualize request flow across protocol boundaries
   - [ ] Basic alert rules committed with protocol-aware thresholds
   - [ ] **Implementation Tasks**:
     - Add health check endpoints (3 pts)
     - Create Grafana dashboards (3 pts)
     - Setup alerting rules and notifications (3 pts)
   - [ ] **Files**: `grafana/` dashboards JSON; `docs/04-OPERATIONS/observability.md`
   - [ ] **Acceptance**: Dashboards for latency/error rate/throughput, basic alerts on error spikes
