# BitVelocity Project Charter

## Executive Summary
BitVelocity is a comprehensive multi-domain distributed learning platform designed to provide hands-on experience with modern backend systems, cloud technologies, and data engineering patterns. The project serves as a practical learning laboratory for mastering enterprise-grade architectural patterns while maintaining cost-effective implementation strategies.

## Mission Statement
Build a production-ready, multi-domain distributed platform that enables comprehensive learning of backend development, cloud deployment, and data engineering using real-world patterns and protocols while minimizing operational costs.

## Core Objectives

### Technical Learning Goals
1. **End-to-End Development Mastery**: Java/Spring Boot development from conception to cloud deployment
2. **Multi-Protocol Implementation**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, SSE, MQTT, AMQP, Kafka, Webhooks, SOAP
3. **Cloud Platform Agnostic**: Pulumi-based infrastructure for seamless migration between GCP, AWS, and Azure
4. **Security by Design**: JWT, OAuth2, HashiCorp Vault, mTLS implementation
5. **Production Observability**: OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing, comprehensive monitoring
6. **Data Engineering**: OLTP to OLAP pipelines, real-time streaming, analytics

### Architectural Principles
1. **Learn Breadth with Sufficient Depth**: Real patterns, not toy "hello world" implementations
2. **Incremental Complexity**: Master each protocol/technology before adding the next
3. **Portability First**: Cloud-agnostic abstractions to avoid vendor lock-in
4. **Shift-Left Everything**: Observability, security, cost control, data governance from day one
5. **Cost-Conscious Learning**: Maximize learning value while minimizing cloud expenses

## Business Context & Constraints

### Team Composition
- **Team Size**: 2-3 developers
- **Time Commitment**: 10-15 hours per week per developer
- **Sprint Duration**: 2-week cycles
- **Project Duration**: Ongoing learning platform (12+ months initial implementation)

### Budget Constraints
- **Target Monthly Cost**: <$200 USD for infrastructure
- **Strategy**: Leverage free tiers, pause/resume infrastructure as needed
- **Cost Optimization**: Use local development, selective cloud deployment

### Success Criteria
- **Technical**: Each protocol/pattern successfully implemented with observability
- **Learning**: Comprehensive understanding demonstrated through working implementations
- **Portability**: Ability to migrate between cloud providers with minimal effort
- **Cost**: Stay within budget while achieving learning objectives

- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (local and cloud)
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for advanced networking patterns

### Data & Persistence
- **OLTP**: PostgreSQL with audit tables and transaction patterns
- **Scale-Out**: Cassandra/MongoDB for high-volume domains
- **OLAP**: Data warehouse/lakehouse patterns (Delta Lake, Iceberg)
- **Caching**: Redis for session/application cache, CDN patterns
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for full-text search and analytics

### Messaging & Communication
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka with Schema Registry
- **Message Queuing**: RabbitMQ for reliable delivery patterns
- **Pub/Sub**: NATS for lightweight messaging
- **API Gateway**: Kong or Envoy for traffic management

### Security
- **Identity**: JWT tokens with refresh patterns
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault for key/secret management
- **Transport**: mTLS for service-to-service communication
- **API Security**: OAuth2, rate limiting, API key management

### Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus with Grafana dashboards
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry with Jaeger
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **APM**: Application performance monitoring integration

## Key Architectural Decisions

### OLTP to OLAP Data Flow
- **Transaction Tables**: Include audit columns (created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at)
- **Change Data Capture**: Debezium for real-time data streaming
- **Data Pipeline**: Bronze (raw) → Silver (cleaned) → Gold (business logic) architecture
- **Analytics**: Real-time dashboards and batch analytics capabilities

### Audit Database Strategy
- **Audit Tables**: Mirror structure of transaction tables with audit metadata
- **Change Tracking**: Track all CRUD operations with user context
- **Retention**: Configurable retention policies for audit data
- **Compliance**: Support for regulatory compliance requirements

### Multi-Cloud Strategy
- **Abstraction Layer**: Pulumi providers for GCP, AWS, Azure
- **Service Interfaces**: Cloud-agnostic service definitions
- **Data Portability**: Use open standards (Parquet, Iceberg) for data formats
- **Migration Strategy**: Blue-green deployments across cloud providers

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity Overload**: Mitigated by incremental introduction of patterns
- **Cost Overruns**: Monitoring and automatic shutdown policies
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Abstraction layers and open standards

### Learning Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Disciplined adherence to sprint planning
- **Knowledge Retention**: Comprehensive documentation and ADRs
