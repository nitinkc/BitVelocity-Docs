# BitVelocity – Domain & Cross-Cutting Architecture Index (Granular Set)

This index points to modular design documents so you can focus on one domain at a time while ensuring seamless interoperability later.

## Domain Architecture Files
1. [E-Commerce Domain](01-ARCHITECTURE/domains/ecommerce/DOMAIN_ECOMMERCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. [Chat Domain](01-ARCHITECTURE/domains/chat/DOMAIN_CHAT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. [IoT Domain](01-ARCHITECTURE/domains/iot/DOMAIN_IOT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
4. [Social Domain](01-ARCHITECTURE/domains/social/DOMAIN_SOCIAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)
5. [ML/AI Domain](01-ARCHITECTURE/domains/ml-ai/DOMAIN_ML_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md) (enabler, optional early)

## Cross-Cutting & Shared
1. [Data Platform & Analytics](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_DATA_PLATFORM_AND_ANALYTICS.md)
2. [Event Contracts & Versioning](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_EVENT_CONTRACTS_AND_VERSIONING.md)
3. [Observability & Testing](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_OBSERVABILITY_AND_TESTING.md)
4. [Execution Backlog & Sprint Plan](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_EXECUTION_BACKLOG_AND_SPRINT_PLAN.md)
5. [Replay & DR Drills](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_REPLAY_DR_DRILLS.md)
6. [Cost Optimization](../01-ARCHITECTURE/CROSS_COST_OPTIMIZATION.md)
7. [Security Strategy](adr/ADR-005-security-layering.md) (Architecture Decision Record)

## Usage Guidance
- Each domain repo includes only its domain file + referenced slices from cross-cutting.
- Event contracts + shared libraries are your “constitution” – do not diverge locally.
- Start with E-Commerce (acts as backbone for most protocols), then Chat, then either IoT or Social depending on interest, then ML/AI integration, finally deeper security & DR.

## Layered Dependency Contract (Do Not Violate)
Shared Libs ← (used by) All Domains  
Security Platform ← (used by) All Domains  
E-Commerce Events → consumed by others (but Order svc never imports Chat code etc.)  
Cross-cutting docs define invariants; domain docs must not redefine them.

Refer to each domain's Interoperability Checklist before implementing.
