## Daily Standup Template

### Daily Questions:
1. **Yesterday**: What did I complete?
2. **Today**: What will I work on?
3. **Blockers**: What's preventing progress?
4. **Learning**: Any technical insights or discoveries?

### Success Metrics:
- [ ] All planned tasks completed on schedule
- [ ] Tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Services deployable to local environment
- [ ] Documentation up-to-date
- [ ] Demo-ready features working

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Docker/K8s complexity**: Start with Docker Compose, add K8s incrementally
- **JWT security issues**: Use proven libraries, conduct security review
- **Database migration issues**: Test migrations in isolated environment first

### Schedule Risks:
- **Task estimation**: Buffer 20% extra time for unknown complexities
- **Learning curve**: Pair programming for knowledge transfer
- **Blocking dependencies**: Identify and resolve early in sprint

## Definition of Done Checklist

Each task is considered complete when:
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Deployed and tested in local environment

This detailed daily plan provides clear, actionable tasks that progress toward Sprint 1 goals while building foundational knowledge for subsequent sprints.
