# ADR-013: ML/AI Platform Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The ML/AI Platform domain provides feature store, model serving, vector search, and analytics. It must support scalable, protocol-agnostic integration and data lineage.

## Decision
- Use a dedicated Feature Store for ML feature management and sharing across domains.
- Model serving exposed via gRPC and REST endpoints for real-time and batch inference.
- Vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) for similarity search and recommendations.
- Analytics pipeline leverages streaming (Kafka) and batch (OLAP warehouse).
- All ML/AI services support event-driven and API-first integration.
- Data lineage and auditability are mandatory for all ML/AI outputs.

## Consequences
- Enables modular, scalable ML/AI capabilities.
- Ensures compliance and traceability for all analytics and model outputs.
- Supports future extensibility for new ML/AI features.
