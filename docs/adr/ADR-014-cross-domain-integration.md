# ADR-014: Cross-Domain Integration & Boundary Enforcement

## Status
Proposed

## Context
BitVelocity is a multi-domain platform. Cross-domain interactions must be secure, observable, and loosely coupled, using well-defined contracts and boundaries.

## Decision
- All cross-domain interactions use versioned event contracts and API schemas.
- API Gateway enforces authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and protocol translation.
- Event contracts (Kafka, AMQP) are backward compatible and schema-validated.
- Data consistency uses event sourcing, CQRS, and compensation patterns (Saga).
- Observability (tracing, logging) is enabled for all cross-domain flows.
- Each domain is independently deployable and failure-isolated.

## Consequences
- Guarantees resilience, security, and maintainability for all cross-domain flows.
- Supports learning and production-readiness goals.
- Enables future extensibility and migration.
